Life, a canvas vast and bright,
Painted with hues of day and night.
A journey wrought with joy and strife,
A wondrous tapestry called life.

In dawn's embrace, the world awakes,
A symphony the morning makes.
The sun climbs high, the sky is wide,

Hope and dreams, our constant guide.
Through fields of green, we chase our dreams,
With laughter's song in rippling streams.
Yet shadows fall as twilight nears,
Our triumphs mixed with silent tears.

In every heart, a story told,
Of love that's warm, and sorrow cold.
With every step, a lesson learned,
With every page, a soul is turned.

Life's winding road, both smooth and rough,
At times, it's kind, at times, it's tough.
Yet through it all, we rise and fall,
To find the beauty in it all.

For in the end, it's not the length,
But moments filled with grace and strength.
A dance, a breath, a fleeting kiss,
In life's embrace, we find our bliss."""
